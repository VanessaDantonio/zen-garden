# CSS Zen Garden

This project delivers a uniquely styled visual theme for the [CSS Zen Garden](https://www.csszengarden.com/) site. The main goal is to completely transform the design using only CSS, while keeping the original HTML structure untouched.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective is to showcase the power and flexibility of CSS by transforming the appearance of the CSS Zen Garden page while strictly preserving its semantic HTML. This design focuses on a Japanese-inspired aesthetic using:

- Radial background patterns
- Classic typography
- Soft color palettes

## 🍵 Design Overview

- **Theme Inspiration**: Traditional Japanese paper, tea culture, and minimalist beauty.
- **Typography**: Serif fonts for content (`Georgia`) and decorative cursive headers (`Tangerine`, via Google Fonts).
- **Layout Highlights**:
  - The main content is horizontally mirrored for a distinctive visual effect.
  - The sidebar and footer use transformed coordinates to create an unconventional but coherent flow.
  - Backgrounds use radial gradients for a stylized patterned effect.
